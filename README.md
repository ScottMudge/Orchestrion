# Orchestrion

Artist-Critic A.I. aimed at autonomous composition of musical pieces, featuring weighted genres and unsupervised learning of stochastic style. 

## What is it?
***Orchestrion*** aims to merge two models of artificial intelligence -- supervised learning [Critic] and unsupervised learning [Artist]. The former [Critic] will be trained to differentiate "good" musical compositions of a specific genre (e.g., jazz) from others and from entirely stochastic musical pieces. The other [Artist] will be trained by the critic to compose music of a specific genre, or weighted mixture of genres, in an unsupervised fashion. 

The end result are (hopefully) novel musical compositions unfettered by impressions of existing works normally created during supervised learning, and also the ability to blend genres by using multiple, weighted genre-specific Critic models to create entirely new musical genres.
